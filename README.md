Fetching RSS flux of "L'Ã©quipe" to have fresh article of my favorite sport !

It's just to play with NextJS and the new feature of postman the "mock server".
I try to test with mocking server directly and not mocking, that allows to have more flexible refactoring.

- To fill the file ".env" for example
  - https://www.lequipe.fr/Tous-sports/Actualites/Les-flux-rss-de-l-equipe/1299546
- To fill the ".env.test" for example
  - use the "mock server" feature in postman : https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/
